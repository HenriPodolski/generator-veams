# Components

This folder contains all modules/components. 

## How to use

### Provide basic templates in this folder

These templates are as general as possible to use them all over the project. 

### Develop your component in a separate folder

Split your component in specific partials and structure them (like we do in BEM-Style). 

__Example:__

* c-article.hbs: contains the wrapper and main content
* c-article__header.hbs: contains header for articles
* c-article__footer.hbs: contains footer for articles


### Document your component

Add a README.md and some assemble comments in your partial.
